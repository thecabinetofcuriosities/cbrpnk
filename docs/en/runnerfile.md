Player Protocols
================

* Embrace the cyberpunk life.
* Go into danger, fall in love with trouble.
* Use your Stress (Push, Assist, Resist).
* Act now, plan (with Flashbacks) later.
* Build your character through play.
* Ask questions when in doubt, to bolster the fictional circumstances or just to satisfy your curiosity.
* Take responsibility as co-author of the game with the Game Moderator.
* Play to find out what happens.

File a Runner
=============

1. Enter a Handle —what they call you on the Grid and streets alike.
2. Enter a few evocative words to describe your Look.
3. You risk it all for a reason. What’s in it for you? Choose an Angle and detail it briefly.
4. Assign 2 , 1 , and 1 in any order to three of your Approaches.
5. Distribute 8 dice over your Skills. To assign an Expertise, spend a third die on a particular Skill—choose or write the Expertise down aside.
6. Body modifications of all types—Cybernetics, Biotech, and others—are widely adopted among Runners. Define your starting **Signature Augmentation** by writing down its model/brand and an outline of its primary feature, e.g., Ashide™ Racing Legs. While taking action or resisting Consequences, you can mark 1 Stress or SPECIAL RESISTANCE to leverage your Augmentation into it. During the Run, you may declare additional Augmentations or extra functionalities of existing ones as UPGRADES (panel 8).
7. Don’t pick your Gear just yet—you’ll decide what you are carrying on the fly during the Run. For now, just circle on the list the ones you are interested in, for easy referencing later.

Augmentations
=============

* Mark 1 Stress to activate an enhanced capability (e.g. therma-vision, wired reflexes, augmented strength) or produce/conceal an specific compact asset (chemicals, blade, nanobots). Can be combined with a Push.
* Mark SPECIAL RESISTANCE to wield it against a fitting type of Consequence (e.g. neural firewall, behavioral analyzer, toxin neutralizer, fireproof coating, etc).

__AUGMENTATION NAME:__

__GLITCHED CHECKBOX__

Load / Gear
===========

During the Run, you may declare gear on-hand by marking it on your list—up to a number of items equal to your LOAD level. If an item is depleted, destroyed, or lost, cross it off the list.

* __LIGHT \[3\]:__ Move freely, blend in easily.
* __MEDIUM \[5\]:__ Look ready for a job.
* __HEAVY \[7\]:__ Loud or slow, very conspicuous.

Gear List
---------

* A BLADE OR TWO (1 Load)
* SIDEARM (1 Load)
* SUBMACHINE GUN (1 Load)
* LARGE/HEAVY WEAPON (2 Load)
* TRACKING DEVICE (1 Load)
* CYBERDECK (1 Load)
* SMALL DRONE (1 Load): STEALTHY or SWIFT
* MEDIUM DRONE (2 Load): TOUGH or OFFENSIVE
* SPARE BATTERY (1 Load)
* MEDKIT (1 Load)
* DISGUISE OR CAMO (1 Load)
* ARMOR (1 Load)
    * +HEAVY (2 Load)
* INFILTRATION GEAR (1 Load)
* EXTRA AMMO (1 Load): STANDARD / PIERCING / EXPLOSIVE / INCENDIARY

* DEMOLITION TOOLS (2 Load)
* MICROTRONICS TOOLS (1 Load)
* SPARE PARTS (1 Load)
* EXTRA LOAD (Up to 4 Load)

⚠ Gear and Augmentations are __Mid-Grade__ by default. When comparing gear between opposing sides, the highest-graded model has an EDGE for their better features. UPGRADE gear with FLASHBACKS.

Stress
======

__STRESS TRACK: 7 SEGMENTS.__

__PUSH:__ 2 Stress / __ASSIST:__ 1 Stress / __FLASHBACK:__ 1 OR 2+ Stress.

__OVERLOAD:__ When you mark your last STRESS , an Approach of your choosing becomes permanently GLITCHED and immediately incurs a complication, such as:

* You are taken out of action.
* You expose the team’s weakness.
* You make the team lose an advantage.
* You damage or overlook something crucial.

While OVERLOADED , you can’t perform actions that would require Stress. TAKE A BREATHER (panel 3) to relieve Stress and clear this status.

Resistance / Armor
==================

Convey how you are RESISTING to reduce the severity of a Consequence or, at the GM’s discretion, avoid it entirely. Then choose a method:

* Mark and deplete either:
    * __SPECIAL RESISTANCE__ (e.g. Envision a defensive use for your Augmentation.)
    * A fitting type of __ARMOR__ (What does it look like?)
* Roll the appropriate APPROACH (don't add Skill this time), add a die if you opt to deplete a relevant GEAR:
    * __6,6:__ 2EZ. That's it.
    * __6:__ Solid. Mark 1 Stress.
    * __4/5:__ Not bad. Mark 2 Stress.
    * __1-3:__ Close. Mark 3 Stress.

Harm
====

If you take Harm of a Level already filled, move it on to a greater Harm Level.

Whenever a HARM would hinder an action, apply its designated PENALTY—when OUT , you can act only if ASSISTED or making a PUSH.

* __Level 1__ — Penalty: Reduced Effect
    * Harm Description (Slot 1):
    * Harm Description (Slot 2):
* __Level 2__ — Penalty: One less die
    * Harm Description (Slot 1):
    * Harm Description (Slot 2):
* __Level 3__ — Penalty: Out
    * Harm Description:
* __Level 4__ — Time to Die.

Special Actions
===============

Push
----

Mark 1 Stress OR add a Glitch to either add a die to your roll OR Increase Effect OR Act when OUT.

Assist
------

Mark 1 Stress and expose yourself to the Consequences to add a die to a teammate’s Action Roll. Only one PC may assist any given roll.

Setup
-----

Make an Action Roll to give an EDGE to yours or anyone else’s future Actions. E.g. provide cover, distract an enemy, plant evidence, etc.

Lead Group
----------

All participating PCs roll for the same Action and pick the best result among them. They all share the outcome, but the leader marks 1 Stress for each FAILURE.

Protect
-------

Take or Resist a Consequence in place of a teammate.

Flashback
---------

Declare to have taken action in the past to impact the current situation—as long as you don’t “undo” something already established. The action is handled just like any other and may call for a roll if danger or trouble are involved. Also, the GM sets a Stress cost depending on its plausibility:

* __1 Stress:__ A standard activity, likely to have occurred.
* __2 Stress or more:__ An elaborate plan involving unlikely factors.

Take a Breather
---------------

Describe how the fiction provides you with an opportunity to unwind—gather your thoughts, take a pill, turn up the volume, punch a wall, check in with a loved one, patch yourself or a teammate up. Roll the appropriate Approach (do not add a Skill), add a die if you bring out your ANGLE , add a die if you deplete appropriate Gear :

* __6,6:__ You’ve been through worse. Clear all Stress -or- ignore both levels 1 and 2 Harm penalties for the remainder of the Run.
* __6:__ That should work. Clear 3 Stress -or- ignore either level 1 or 2 Harm penalties for the remainder of the Run.
* __4/5:__ Suck it up. Clear 2 Stress -or- ignore level 1 Harm penalties for the remainder of the Run.
* __1-3:__ Take what you can get. Clear 1 Stress.

Assets / Upgrades
=================

Call for a FLASHBACK to establish how you acquired it:

__ASSETS:__ Vehicles, experts, safehouses, or data. E.g.: cyberdeck program, building’s blueprint, info broker.

__AUGMENTATIONS:__ Additional body enhancements with different features from previous ones.

__UPGRADES:__ Enhance a Gear to High-Grade or add an extra feature to a Gear, Augmentation, or Asset already in use. E.g.: Heat-seeker projectiles; Armored wheels; Self-repairs with nanobots; Elite street doc.

Reduce the Flashback’s cost when declaring an Asset, Augmentation, or Upgrade by picking a fitting __DRAWBACK__ :

* It’s large and/or heavy. Mark 1 or 2 __EXTRA LOAD__.
* It is unstable or damaged beyond repair (e.g., an obsolete augmentation, corrupted program, makeshift weapon). Mark it as __GLITCHED__.
* It was never really paid for and now you are being __HUNTED__. Who sent them after you and what for? Whenever you attract unwanted attention, it may be their Hunter pinning you down.
* You’ve made a promise or cut a deal. Name your patron/sponsor and mark a __DEBT__.

* * *
