# CBR+PNK 

## Plain Text Core Rules
_v1.6 April 2024_

**CBR+PNK IS A FORGED IN THE DARK GAME FOR ONE-SHOT SESSIONS OF CINEMATIC CYBERPUNK ACTION.**

PLAYER Characters (PCs) are **RUNNERS**—mercs, criminals, rebels, living on the edge and running in the shadows of a gritty, ultraviolent world. In each game they are brought to life as a team, ready to make huge compromises to score their Angle by going on one **LAST /RUN**.

Their fixer is known simply as **OPERATOR**, an anonymous flat voice over the comlink who sees them as nothing more than disposable assets.

The **SPRAWL** can be any overcrowded megacity consumed by high tech, class struggle, intrusive advertising, corporatocracy, poor quality automated services, climate crash, the futile search for humanity amongst all this, and so on.

The **GRID** is made up of servers across the globe through which data flows frantically. On the surface level are public records, media streams, everyday apps. Sensitive information is protected by ICP (Intrusion Countermeasure Protocols). Megacorps and obscenely wealthy individuals run their own private servers, accessed only from terminals inside well-secured facilities.

The **GAME MODERATOR (GM)** uses the game rules to establish a dynamic world around the PCs. They help organize the conversation so it’s pointed toward interesting elements of play.

{: .content }
This game touches sensitive topics like racial stigma, class segregation, large-scale disaster, violence and substance abuse. Because of that, it is intended for mature players, with mutual trust and safety tools in place (e.g. the X-card, Lines & Veils and Open Door).
