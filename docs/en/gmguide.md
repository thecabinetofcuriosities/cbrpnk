# GAME MODERATOR'S GUIDE

Game Moderator Protocols
========================

* Play to find out what happens.
* Telegraph trouble before it hits. Establish a threat implying tone and hinting at its intent.
* Follow through with established threats. Do not pull punches, the PCs have plenty of tools at their disposal to deal with adversity.
* Ask questions to set the stage, to encourage players to express their characters, bolster the fictional circumstances, satisfy curiosity, or to bring in the players when you’re stuck.
* Provide context. Convey a vibrant world of high tech and low life around the Players’ characters.
* Present interesting situations, then build upon their choices.
* Cut to the action.

Game Setup
==========

In order to play you will need the GM Guide and a Runner File for each player.

A game of CBR+PNK revolves around our characters’ **LAST RUN** —a high-stakes operation with a clear OBJECTIVE , best suited for veteran RUNNERS.

As a GM, you can prepare Run outlines in advance or generate them on the spot using the prompts found in the FRAMEWORK brochure. Players can also come up with their own Run outlines, possibly setting up for their PCs’ ANGLES and eventual HUNTED statuses.

After selecting the Run, ask the Players to file their Runners (build their PCs).

On your end, write a couple of LOCATIONS , potential ASSETS and make a list with 3-6 obstacles that may be encountered.

Do not overprepare: this is a type of game where you **PLAY TO FIND OUT** what happens.

When everyone is ready, recap the Run’s OBJECTIVE and let the players select their ENGAGEMENT PLAN (their main course of action) and answer the follow-up question.

* __ASSAULT:__ Point of attack?
* __DECEPTION:__ Method of deception?
* __STEALTH:__ Point of infiltration?
* __SOCIAL:__ Connection to be leveraged?
* __TRANSPORT:__ Route and means?

They don’t have to detail every step of the plan—the nitty-gritty of it happens off-screen. Ask them to select their LOAD and cut straight to the action.

### 1 / COMING IN HOT

Describe the LOCATION and circumstances the PCs start in based on their ENGAGEMENT PLAN. They’ve already successfully dealt with minor inconveniences and now engage with the first significant obstacle: a shoot out, chase, checkpoint, etc. Go around the table asking each Player to introduce their Runner while dealing with the trouble in their own way—possibly triggering some ACTION ROLLS.

### 2 / ERROR 417: EXPECTATION FAILED

Build up on their actions and, as they get closer to the objective, you should have enough to put them in a spot. Reveal a twist, possibly challenging the PCs’ priorities or interests—maybe the data they were stealing is the first known awakened AI; The rogue synthetics show empathy towards their creators; This gig’s client is revealed to be the Runners’ common enemy; Some shady organization is also interested in the target.

The FINAL OBSTACLE can be a resourceful individual, a resilient machine, a difficult choice.

When the Run’s OBJECTIVE is concluded (successfully or not), wrap it up and fast forward to the epilogues.

### 3 / LOGOFF

The runners have received their reward (or bad news, if they’ve failed) and now we see how they leverage it to score their Angle.

The outcome of their epilogue is determined by an ANGLE ROLL.

ANGLE ROLL
----------

On their turn, a player declares what APPROACH they will employ to pull off their Angle and gathers the corresponding dice. They also get:

* \-1D if the chosen Approach is GLITCHED (don’t add Glitch dice for this roll).
* \-1D for each marked DEBT.
* \-1D if they overlooked or failed to comply with one or more critical requirements: time constraints, quality, integrity etc. Or -2D if they abandoned the mission.
* +1D for each marked CRED : captured a bounty, extracted and sold corporate secrets, found a stash of untraceable credsticks, did a solid for Mx. Smith.

⚠ If ending up with zero or less dice: roll 2 dice and keep the lowest.

Player rolls and describes what happens to their character (5 min per player should be enough).

If they don’t like the outcome, they can step up the result at a huge cost: something/someone they love, their ideals, themselves.

* 6,6: You succeeded remarkably. After all other players are done, choose who you offer a hand to—improve their result by one step. Describe together how this works in the fiction.
* 6: You got out of it mostly intact, but why it doesn’t feel like a win?
* 4/5: You did it, but you know it won’t last. How do you prepare?
* 1-3: You’ve failed. How do your actions only manage to set you back even further?

Action Roll
===========

When a Player Character faces a risky or troublesome situation, the outcome is determined by the ACTION ROLL :

1. The player describes what they want to accomplish and what Approach , Skill , and any other factor (gear, augment, environmental aspect) they will employ to do so. 
 There is no “wrong” Approach to a situation, but some may be less effective or result in more severe consequences, prompting the Player to rethink their course of action to improve their positioning.
2. The GM assesses the risk and tells them what are the probable Consequences. 
 If any or both sides have Edges on distinct aspects of the situation, they will then inform what Threat and Effect Levels can be expected—otherwise use the standard Level 2.
3. The Player can then raise both Threat and Effect simultaneously to improve their Effect at the cost of a worse Consequence or vice-versa.
4. Player gathers their dice:
 * A number equal to Approach+Skill ratings.
 * Add bonus dice from Push and/or Assist.
 ⚠ If ending up with zero or less dice, they must roll two dice and keep the lowest.
5. The Player rolls their dice and reads the single highest result, judging the outcome by the table below.

Player and GM work together narrating the action, but the latter has the final say over the outcome and is the one declaring eventual Consequences.

* 6,6: Critical. They succeed and gain an extra benefit (, uncover a secret, improved position, pinpoint a bounty).
* 6: Success. It goes as well as intended.
* 4/5: Partial Success. They succeed, but it comes with a Consequence.
* 1-3: Failure. Things go bad as they fail and also suffer a Consequence.

GLITCH DICE
-----------

Each __GLITCHED__ factor used on an Action Roll replaces a normal die with a __GLITCH die__—use a die that’s easily discernible from the rest.

After judging the outcome as usual, read the lowest GLITCH separately. On a 1-3 , it triggers a further Level 2 Consequence that can’t be Resisted; on a 4/5 , the additional Consequence can be Resisted normally.

Threat / Effect / Edge
======================

Threat Level (T) informs the danger posed by the situation and what/how much the PC can lose on a partial success or failure. Effect Level (E) gauges how much is accomplished on a success. They are both set to LEVEL 2 by standard and go up to Level 4.

In a conflict, each side may have an EDGE from how they are using gear, tactics, environment, or opposition weaknesses to their advantage—only the most significant factors should be considered. Edges can Increase or Reduce either levels in the respective side’s favor:

* If the OPPOSITION has an Edge allowing them to respond more effectively, Increase Threat. If their Edge improves their defenses or diminishes the PC’s efforts would Reduce Effect.
* If the RUNNER has an Edge that can avoid or mitigate retaliation from the Threat, Reduce Threat. An Edge that increases their effectiveness might give Increased Effect.
 * Using an Expertise , they can trade a die for an Edge.
 * They can choose to Push themselves for Increased Effect.

Consequences
============

Inflicted by enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll. informs the Harm level, the ticks on a Track, the severity of the Complication, etc

* __Reduced Effect:__ their action falls short and causes Reduced Effect.
* __Harm:__ lasting condition or injury. Requires time or treatment to recover.
* __Complication:__ compromise assets (e.g. cyber becomes GLITCHED), deplete resources (e.g. ammo), start and/or advance a troublesome Progress Track.
* __Threat Escalation:__ they lose control of the situation, take away an Edge or safeguard to Increase Threat.
* __Lost Opportunity:__ circumstances shift, they must find a new approach.

Combine these as the fiction dictates. E.g. a Runner facing a Threat 3 enemy rolls a Failure. As a Consequence, the GM could deal a level 3 Harm or a level 1 Harm and have the enemy disarm them.

Runners can __Resist__ each Consequence separately.

Each Harm Level implies a penalty to pertinent Action Rolls (may be disregarded later by Taking a Breather). When a PC takes Harm of a Level already filled, it moves on to a greater Level. If they take Harm but there is no slot left to fill, it’s Time to Die.

Therefore, Level 4 harm is FATAL if not Resisted and should be inflicted only when the stakes are clear.

Progress Tracks
===============

Assign Progress Tracks of 4, 6, or 8 segments when a situation is complex and you need to track ongoing effort or progress over time—otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll. Even more complex obstacles might feature layered Tracks to represent the multiple steps needed to overcome it.

When PCs make progress towards an objective, tick a number of segments in the Progress Track equal to their Effect Level. When progress is made by an opposition, tick a number of segments equal to the Threat Level.

Employ Progress Tracks to:

* __Mark progress on a task:__ the endurance of an enemy; a system’s integrity. The task is completed when the Progress Track fills up.
* __Set up a countdown:__ reinforcements’ arrival; a time bomb. Trouble ensues when the Track fills up.
* __Represent a race:__ a hacker infiltrating a network while security closes in. Set two opposed Tracks, they don’t even have to be the same size.

Adversary Skill
===============

Adversaries’ capabilities manifest through Progress Tracks, the severity of the Consequences they deal (as a result of fictional standings), and ultimately, their Skill level.

When **Regular** adversaries are involved, the PCs’ Action Rolls determine the outcome for both sides simultaneously. A single roll tells us how their actions interact and which Consequences result.

When **Skilled** adversaries act, they are about to accomplish something. How the Runners respond—and their rolls—determine how effective the adversary was.

By taking the initiative, when **Elite** adversaries act they can inflict a Consequence that must be Resisted before the Runners also have a chance to act.

Player Protocols
================

* Embrace the cyberpunk life.
* Go into danger, fall in love with trouble.
* Use your Stress (Push, Assist, Resist).
* Act now, plan (with Flashbacks) later.
* Build your character through play.
* Ask questions when in doubt, to bolster the fictional circumstances or just to satisfy your curiosity.
* Take responsibility as co-author of the game with the Game Moderator.
* Play to find out what happens.

File a Runner
=============

1. Enter a Handle —what they call you on the Grid and streets alike.
2. Enter a few evocative words to describe your Look.
3. You risk it all for a reason. What’s in it for you? Choose an Angle and detail it briefly.
4. Assign 2 , 1 , and 1 in any order to three of your Approaches.
5. Distribute 8 dice over your Skills. To assign an Expertise, spend a third die on a particular Skill—choose or write the Expertise down aside.
6. Body modifications of all types—Cybernetics, Biotech, and others—are widely adopted among Runners. Define your starting Signature Augmentation by writing down its model/brand and an outline of its primary feature, e.g., Ashidetm Racing Legs. While taking action or resisting Consequences, you can mark 1 Stress or SPECIAL RESISTANCE to leverage your Augmentation into it. During the Run, you may declare additional Augmentations or extra functionalities of existing ones as UPGRADES (panel 8).
7. Don’t pick your Gear just yet—you’ll decide what you are carrying on the fly during the Run. For now, just circle on the list the ones you are interested in, for easy referencing later.

Augmentations
=============

* Mark 1 Stress to activate an enhanced capability (e.g. therma-vision, wired reflexes, augmented strength) or produce/conceal an specific compact asset (chemicals, blade, nanobots). Can be combined with a Push.
* Mark SPECIAL RESISTANCE to wield it against a fitting type of Consequence (e.g. neural firewall, behavioral analyzer, toxin neutralizer, fireproof coating, etc).

AUGMENTATION NAME:

GLITCHED CHECKBOX

Load / Gear
===========

During the Run, you may declare gear on-hand by marking it on your list—up to a number of items equal to your LOAD level. If an item is depleted, destroyed, or lost, cross it off the list.

* LIGHT \[3\]: Move freely, blend in easily.
* MEDIUM \[5\]: Look ready for a job.
* HEAVY \[7\]: Loud or slow, very conspicuous.

Gear List
---------

* A BLADE OR TWO (1 Load)
* SIDEARM (1 Load)
* SUBMACHINE GUN (1 Load)
* LARGE/HEAVY WEAPON (2 Load)
* TRACKING DEVICE (1 Load)
* CYBERDECK (1 Load)
* SMALL DRONE (1 Load): STEALTHY or SWIFT
* MEDIUM DRONE (2 Load): TOUGH or OFFENSIVE
* SPARE BATTERY (1 Load)
* MEDKIT (1 Load)
* DISGUISE OR CAMO (1 Load)
* ARMOR (1 Load)

* +HEAVY (2 Load)

* INFILTRATION GEAR (1 Load)

* MICROTRONICS TOOLS (1 Load)
* SPARE PARTS (1 Load)
* EXTRA LOAD (Up to 4 Load)

⚠ Gear and Augmentations are Mid-Grade by default. When comparing gear between opposing sides, the highest-graded model has an EDGE for their better features. UPGRADE gear with FLASHBACKS.

Stress
======

STRESS TRACK: 7 SEGMENTS.

PUSH: 2 Stress / ASSIST: 1 Stress / FLASHBACK: 1 OR 2+ Stress.

OVERLOAD: When you mark your last STRESS , an Approach of your choosing becomes permanently GLITCHED and immediately incurs a complication, such as:

* You are taken out of action.
* You expose the team’s weakness.
* You make the team lose an advantage.
* You damage or overlook something crucial.

While OVERLOADED , you can’t perform actions that would require Stress. TAKE A BREATHER (panel 3) to relieve Stress and clear this status.

Resistance / Armor
==================

Convey how you are RESISTING to reduce the severity of a Consequence or, at the GM’s discretion, avoid it entirely. Then choose a method:

* Mark and deplete either:

* SPECIAL RESISTANCE (e.g. Envision a defensive use for your Augmentation.)
* A fitting type of ARMOR (What does it look like?)

* Roll the appropriate APPROACH (don't add Skill this time), add a die if you opt to deplete a relevant GEAR:

* 6,6: 2EZ. That's it.
* 6: Solid. Mark 1 Stress.
* 4/5: Not bad. Mark 2 Stress.
* 1-3: Close. Mark 3 Stress.

Harm
====

If you take Harm of a Level already filled, move it on to a greater Harm Level.

Whenever a HARM would hinder an action, apply its designated PENALTY—when OUT , you can act only if ASSISTED or making a PUSH.

* Level 1 — Penalty: Reduced Effect

* Harm Description (Slot 1):
* Harm Description (Slot 2):

* Level 2 — Penalty: One less die

* Harm Description (Slot 1):
* Harm Description (Slot 2):

* Level 3 — Penalty: Out

* Harm Description:

* Level 4 — Time to Die.

Special Actions
===============

Push
----

Mark 1 Stress OR add a Glitch to either add a die to your roll OR Increase Effect OR Act when OUT.

Assist
------

Mark 1 Stress and expose yourself to the Consequences to add a die to a teammate’s Action Roll. Only one PC may assist any given roll.

Setup
-----

Make an Action Roll to give an EDGE to yours or anyone else’s future Actions. E.g. provide cover, distract an enemy, plant evidence, etc.

Lead Group
----------

All participating PCs roll for the same Action and pick the best result among them. They all share the outcome, but the leader marks 1 Stress for each FAILURE.

Protect
-------

Take or Resist a Consequence in place of a teammate.

Flashback
---------

Declare to have taken action in the past to impact the current situation—as long as you don’t “undo” something already established. The action is handled just like any other and may call for a roll if danger or trouble are involved. Also, the GM sets a Stress cost depending on its plausibility:

* 1 Stress: A standard activity, likely to have occurred.
* 2 Stress or more: An elaborate plan involving unlikely factors.

Take a Breather
---------------

Describe how the fiction provides you with an opportunity to unwind—gather your thoughts, take a pill, turn up the volume, punch a wall, check in with a loved one, patch yourself or a teammate up. Roll the appropriate Approach (do not add a Skill), add a die if you bring out your ANGLE , add a die if you deplete appropriate Gear :

* 6,6: You’ve been through worse. Clear all Stress -or- ignore both levels 1 and 2 Harm penalties for the remainder of the Run.
* 6: That should work. Clear 3 Stress -or- ignore either level 1 or 2 Harm penalties for the remainder of the Run.
* 4/5: Suck it up. Clear 2 Stress -or- ignore level 1 Harm penalties for the remainder of the Run.
* 1-3: Take what you can get. Clear 1 Stress.

Assets / Upgrades
=================

Call for a FLASHBACK to establish how you acquired it:

__ASSETS:__ Vehicles, experts, safehouses, or data. E.g.: cyberdeck program, building’s blueprint, info broker.

__AUGMENTATIONS:__ Additional body enhancements with different features from previous ones.

__UPGRADES:__ Enhance a Gear to High-Grade or add an extra feature to a Gear, Augmentation, or Asset already in use. E.g.: Heat-seeker projectiles; Armored wheels; Self-repairs with nanobots; Elite street doc.

Reduce the Flashback’s cost when declaring an Asset, Augmentation, or Upgrade by picking a fitting DRAWBACK :

* It’s large and/or heavy. Mark 1 or 2 EXTRA LOAD.
* It is unstable or damaged beyond repair (e.g., an obsolete augmentation, corrupted program, makeshift weapon). Mark it as GLITCHED.
* It was never really paid for and now you are being HUNTED. Who sent them after you and what for? Whenever you attract unwanted attention, it may be their Hunter pinning you down.
* You’ve made a promise or cut a deal. Name your patron/sponsor and mark a DEBT.
