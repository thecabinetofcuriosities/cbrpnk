# ROOKIE

How to Use
==========

* Use a standard Runner File, follow the instructions bellow to fill it out.
* Play the character across various /Runs, regardless of the cast.
* Don’t worry about Downtime in between /Runs, unless you’re playing *Long-shot mode* (described in the *Framework* brochure).
* Limit to one per crew.
This /Plugin’s goal is to offer a more challenging character type, that can be easily integrated into a series of /Runs and combined with various other Runners, while also providing some connection between them.

Filing a Rookie
===============

* **Approaches:** Pick 2 Approaches, each gets 1 die.
* **Skills:** Distribute 6 dice (instead of 8); Limited to one Specialization.
* Your **Signature Augmentation** starts GLITCHED**.**
* Your **Handle** has to be *Rookie* until you Graduate.
* Everything else remains the same.

Angle
=====

You start with a short-term goal and the naive idea that working on a certain Angle will solve your problems for good. 
After each Angle Roll, the GM describes what new problem arises as a consequence of the roll and your choices during the /Run. As these problems add to (or worsen) your existing troubles, change your Angle as much as needed to better reflect your goals.

Beats
=====

Spotlight moments where the Rookie expresses their vulnerability, ingenuity and lack of experience.

Tick a box whenever you feel it’s the right time to trigger a Beat. Some of these Beats function as special abilities, bending the game rules, while others are purely narrative.

When all boxes are ticked, the Rookie graduates after the following Angle Roll – the amount of Beats you trigger each session determines how fast that happens.

[2 Ticks] Start a /Run with 2 marked Stress, regardless of how you ended the previous.

[2 Ticks] Gear Restrictions: your network is not quite build up yet. Upgrades and Assets cost an extra Stress to declare. *Tip: pick up Drawbacks like Debt or Hunted in order to cut Stress costs.*

[2 Ticks] Endanger the crew by making a rookie mistake (examples below).

[2 Ticks] Assist a Runner on a challenge clearly above your level with a Skill you don’t have dice on.

[1 Tick] Mark Special Resistance to avoid any type of Consequence by sheer luck.

[1 Tick] A Runner gets +1D to Resist when Protecting you from a Consequence.

[1 Tick] Take Harm of Level 2 or greater when Protecting a crew mate.

[1 Tick] When you Overload, instead of marking an Approach as Glitched, gain +1 to any Approach.

[1 Tick] Learn a harsh truth about the Runner life.

Rookie Mistakes
===============

* Underestimating the threat.
* Overestimating their own abilities.
* Taking the enemy’s bait.
* Inadvertently spilling the beans.
* Stubbornly ignoring orders.
* Over-committing to the plan.
* Trusting the wrong person.
* Taking a Breather at the wrong moment.
* Misjudge crucial details.
* Falling for an obvious trap.

Graduation
==========

You’re not a *Rookie* anymore. Choose your hard earned Handle, the one you’ll build a reputation on. Additionally, increase your Approach and Skill rating to match a veteran Runner, and clear your Signature Augmentation’s Glitched status (describe how your fix or replace it).

Next time we see you again, perhaps weeks or years will have passed – it’ll be your **LAST RUN**.

Shared Character
================

In this mode, players take turns playing the Rookie while also playing their own Runners. During character creation, make sure everyone is on board with the shared character’s personality and ambitions.

During the opening situation, whichever player has an ideia for kicking off the Rookie should do it – acting along with their own Runner, if they wish so. From that point on, each time the Rookie’s active player ticks a Beat box, the control of the character passes to someone else. Aim to have each player decide the Rookie’s course of action at least once per session.
