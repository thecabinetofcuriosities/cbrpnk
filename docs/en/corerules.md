# Core Rules
_v1.5 March 2023_

[TABLE OF CONTENTS]{.c2 .c17}

[CBR+PNK]{.c2} [ IS A FORGED IN THE DARK GAME FOR ONE-SHOT SESSIONS OF
CINEMATIC CYBERPUNK ACTION.]{.c3 .c0}

[PLAYER Characters (PCs)]{.c2} [ are ]{.c0} [RUNNERS]{.c2} [---mercs,
criminals, rebels, living on the edge and running in the shadows of a
gritty, ultraviolent world. In each game they are brought to life as a
team, ready to make huge compromises to score their angle by going on
one ]{.c0} [LAST RUN]{.c2} [.]{.c3 .c0}

[Their fixer is known simply as ]{.c0} [OPERATOR]{.c2} [, an anonymous
flat voice over the comlink who sees them as nothing more than
disposable assets.]{.c3 .c0}

[The ]{.c0} [SPRAWL]{.c2} [ can be any overcrowded megacity consumed by
high tech, class struggle, intrusive advertising, corporatocracy,
automated services of poor quality, climate crash, the futile search for
humanity amongst all this, and so on.]{.c3 .c0}

[The ]{.c0} [GRID]{.c2} [ is made up of servers across the globe through
which data flows frantically. On the surface level are public records,
media streams, everyday apps. Sensitive information is protected by ICP
(Intrusion Countermeasure Protocols). Megacorps and obscenely wealthy
individuals run their own private servers, accessed only from terminals
inside well-secured facilities.]{.c3 .c0}

[The ]{.c0} [GAME MODERATOR (GM)]{.c2} [ refers to the game rules to
establish a dynamic world around the PCs. They help organize the
conversation so it's pointed toward interesting elements of play.]{.c0}

* * *

[]{.c20 .c0 .c17}

[CONTENT WARNING]{.c20 .c2 .c17}

[This game touches sensitive topics like racial stigma, class
segregation, large-scale disaster, violence and substance abuse. Because
of that, it is intended for mature players, with mutual trust and safety
tools in place (e.g. the X-card, Lines & Veils and Open Door).]{.c3 .c0}

[GM Guide]{.c2 .c34}

# [Game Moderator Protocols]{.c13 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.ljq88gsyehzv .c5}

-   [Play to find out what happens.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Telegraph trouble before it hits. Establish a threat implying tone
    and hinting at its intent.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Follow through with established threats. Do not pull punches, the
    PCs have plenty of tools at their disposal to deal with
    adversity.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Ask questions to set the stage, to encourage players to express
    their characters, bolster the fictional circumstances, satisfy
    curiosity, or to bring in the players when you're stuck.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Provide context. Convey a vibrant world of high tech and low life
    around the Players' characters.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Present interesting situations, then build upon their choices.]{.c3
    .c0}
-   [Cut to the action.]{.c3 .c0}

# [Game Setup]{.c13 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.izrbwwji114s .c5}

[In order to play you will need the ]{.c0} [GM Guide ]{.c2} [and a
]{.c0} [Runner File]{.c2} [ for each player.]{.c3 .c0}

[A game of ]{.c0} [CBR+PNK]{.c2} [ revolves around our characters'
]{.c0} [LAST RUN]{.c2} [---a high-stakes operation with a clear ]{.c0}
[OBJECTIVE]{.c2} [, best suited for veteran ]{.c0} [RUNNERS]{.c2}
[.]{.c3 .c0}

[As a GM, you can prepare Run outlines in advance or generate them on
the spot using the prompts found in the ]{.c0} [FRAMEWORK]{.c2}
[ brochure. Players can also come up with their own Run outlines,
possibly setting up for their PCs' ]{.c0} [ANGLES]{.c2} [ and eventual
]{.c0} [HUNTED]{.c2} [ statuses.]{.c3 .c0}

[After selecting the Run, ask the Players to file their ]{.c0}
[Runners]{.c2} [ (build their PCs).]{.c3 .c0}

[On your end, write a couple of ]{.c0} [LOCATIONS]{.c2} [, potential
]{.c0} [ASSETS]{.c2} [ and make a list with 3-6 obstacles that may be
encountered.]{.c3 .c0}

[Do not ]{.c0} [overprepare]{.c0} [: this is a type of game where you
]{.c0} [PLAY TO FIND OUT]{.c2} [ what happens.]{.c3 .c0}

[When everyone is ready, recap the Run's ]{.c0} [OBJECTIVE]{.c2} [ and
let the players select their ]{.c0} [ENGAGEMENT PLAN]{.c2} [ (their main
course of action) and answer the follow-up question.]{.c3 .c0}

-   [ASSAULT:]{.c2} [ Point of attack?]{.c3 .c0}
-   [DECEPTION:]{.c2} [ Method of deception?]{.c3 .c0}
-   [STEALTH:]{.c2} [ Point of infiltration?]{.c3 .c0}
-   [SOCIAL:]{.c2} [ Connection to be leveraged?]{.c3 .c0}
-   [TRANSPORT:]{.c2} [ Route and means?]{.c3 .c0}

[They don't have to detail every step of the plan---the nitty-gritty of
it happens off-screen. Ask them to select their ]{.c0} [LOAD]{.c2} [ and
cut straight to the action.]{.c3 .c0}

### [1 / COMING IN HOT]{.c2 .c9} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.r82e15v8gfgm .c27}

[Describe the ]{.c0} [LOCATION]{.c2} [ and circumstances the PCs start
in based on their ]{.c0} [ENGAGEMENT PLAN]{.c2} [. They've already
successfully dealt with minor inconveniences and now engage with the
first significant obstacle: a shoot out, chase, checkpoint, etc. Go
around the table asking each Player to introduce their Runner while
dealing with the trouble in their own way---possibly triggering some
]{.c0} [ACTION ROLLS]{.c2} [.]{.c3 .c0}

### [2 / ERROR 417: EXPECTATION FAILED]{.c9 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.i28qejpygame .c27}

[Build up on their actions and, as they get closer to the objective, you
should have enough to put them in a spot. Reveal a twist, possibly
challenging the PCs' priorities or interests---maybe the data they were
stealing is the first known awakened AI; The rogue synthetics show
empathy towards their creators; This gig's client is revealed to be the
Runners' common enemy; Some shady organization is also interested in the
target.]{.c3 .c0}

[The ]{.c0} [FINAL OBSTACLE]{.c2} [ can be a resourceful individual, a
resilient machine, a difficult choice.]{.c3 .c0}

[When the Run's ]{.c0} [OBJECTIVE]{.c2} [ is concluded (successfully or
not), wrap it up and fast forward to the epilogues.]{.c3 .c0}

### [3 / LOGOFF]{.c9 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.bt53z4c8p6ln .c27}

[The runners have received their reward (or bad news, if they've failed)
and now we see how they leverage it to score their ]{.c0} [Angle]{.c2}
[.]{.c3 .c0}

[The outcome of their epilogue is determined by an ]{.c0} [ANGLE
ROLL]{.c2} [.]{.c3 .c0}

## [ANGLE ROLL]{.c20 .c2 .c42} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.9rhg7bp2vt81 .c4}

[On their turn, a player declares what ]{.c0} [APPROACH]{.c2} [ they
will employ to pull off their Angle and gathers the corresponding dice.
They also get:]{.c3 .c0}

-   [-1D if the chosen Approach is ]{.c0} [GLITCHED]{.c2} [ (don't add
    Glitch dice for this roll).]{.c3 .c0}
-   [-1D for each marked ]{.c0} [DEBT]{.c2} [.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [-1D if they overlooked or failed to comply with one or more
    critical requirements: time constraints, quality, integrity etc. Or
    -2D if they abandoned the mission.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [+1D for each marked ]{.c0} [CRED]{.c2} [: captured a bounty,
    extracted and sold corporate secrets, found a stash of untraceable
    credsticks, ]{.c0} [did]{.c0} [ a solid for Mx. Smith.]{.c3 .c0}

[⚠]{.c0} [ If ending up with zero or less dice: roll 2 dice and keep the
lowest.]{.c1 .c0}

[Player rolls and describes what happens to their character (5 min per
player should be enough).]{.c3 .c0}

[If they don't like the outcome, they can step up the result at a huge
cost: something/someone they love, their ideals, themselves.]{.c3 .c0}

-   [6,6:]{.c2} [ You succeeded remarkably. After all other players are
    done, choose who you offer a hand to---improve their result by one
    step. Describe together how this works in the fiction.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [6:]{.c2} [ You got out of it mostly intact, but why ]{.c0} [it
    doesn't]{.c0} [ feel like a win?]{.c3 .c0}
-   [4/5:]{.c2} [ You did it, but you know it won't last. How do you
    prepare?]{.c3 .c0}
-   [1-3:]{.c2} [ You've failed. How do your actions only manage to set
    you back even further?]{.c3 .c0}

# [Action Roll]{.c13 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.5aq7r229h2mn .c5}

[When a Player Character faces a risky or troublesome situation, the
outcome is determined by the ]{.c0} [ACTION ROLL]{.c2} [:]{.c3 .c0}

1.  [The player describes what they want to accomplish and what ]{.c0}
    [Approach]{.c2} [, ]{.c0} [Skill]{.c2} [ , and any other factor
    (gear, augment, environmental aspect) they will employ to do so.\
    ]{.c0} [There is no "wrong" Approach to a situation, but some may be
    less effective or result in more severe consequences, prompting the
    Player to rethink their course of action to improve their
    positioning.]{.c1 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  [The GM assesses the risk and tells them what are the probable
    ]{.c0} [Consequences]{.c2} [ .\
    If any or both sides have ]{.c0} [Edges]{.c2} [ on distinct aspects
    of the situation, they will then inform what ]{.c0} [Threat]{.c2}
    [ and ]{.c0} [Effect]{.c2} [ Levels can be expected---otherwise use
    the standard Level 2.]{.c3 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  [The Player can then raise both ]{.c0} [Threat]{.c2} [ and ]{.c0}
    [Effect]{.c2} [ simultaneously to improve their ]{.c0} [Effect]{.c2}
    [ at the cost of a worse ]{.c0} [Consequence]{.c2} [ or
    vice-versa.]{.c3 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  [Player gathers their dice:]{.c3 .c0}

-   [A number equal to ]{.c0} [Approach+Skill]{.c2} [ ratings.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Add bonus dice from ]{.c0} [Push]{.c2} [ and/or ]{.c0}
    [Assist]{.c2} [.]{.c3 .c0}

[⚠]{.c0} [ If ending up with zero or less dice, they must roll two dice
and keep the lowest.]{.c1 .c0}

5.  [The Player rolls their dice and reads the single highest result,
    judging the outcome by the table below.]{.c3 .c0}

[Player and GM work together narrating the action, but the latter has
the final say over the outcome and is the one declaring eventual ]{.c0}
[Consequences]{.c2} [.]{.c3 .c0}

-   [6,6: Critical.]{.c2} [ They succeed and gain an extra benefit (,
    uncover a secret, improved position, pinpoint a bounty).]{.c3 .c0}
-   [6: Success.]{.c2} [ It goes as well as intended.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [4/5: Partial Success.]{.c2} [ They succeed, but it comes with a
    Consequence.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [1-3: Failure.]{.c2} [ Things go bad as they fail and also suffer a
    Consequence.]{.c3 .c0}

## [GLITCH DICE]{.c20 .c2 .c42} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.yjs2dsaqpx0y .c4}

[Each ]{.c0} [GLITCHED]{.c2} [ factor used on an ]{.c0} [Action
Roll]{.c2} [ replaces a normal die with a ]{.c0} [GLITCH]{.c2}
[ die---use a die that's easily discernible from the rest.]{.c3 .c0}

[After judging the outcome as usual, read the lowest ]{.c0}
[GLITCH]{.c2} [ separately. On a ]{.c0} [1-3]{.c2} [, it triggers a
further Level 2 Consequence that can't be Resisted; on a ]{.c0}
[4/5]{.c2} [, the additional Consequence can be Resisted normally.]{.c3
.c0}

# [Threat / Effect / Edge]{.c13 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.nvxixgfh8d4n .c5}

[Threat Level (T)]{.c2} [ informs the danger posed by the situation and
what/how much the PC can lose on a partial success or failure. ]{.c0}
[Effect Level (E)]{.c2} [ gauges how much is accomplished on a success.
They are both set to ]{.c0} [LEVEL 2]{.c2} [ by standard and go up to
Level 4.]{.c3 .c0}

[In a conflict, each side may have an ]{.c0} [EDGE]{.c2} [ from how they
are using gear, tactics, environment, or opposition weaknesses to their
advantage---only the most significant factors should be considered.
Edges can Increase or Reduce either levels in the respective side's
favor:]{.c3 .c0}

-   [If the ]{.c0} [OPPOSITION]{.c2} [ has an ]{.c0} [Edge]{.c2}
    [ allowing them to respond more effectively, Increase Threat. If
    their ]{.c0} [Edge]{.c2} [ improves their defenses or diminishes the
    PC's efforts would Reduce Effect.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [If the ]{.c0} [RUNNER]{.c2} [ has an ]{.c0} [Edge]{.c2} [ that can
    avoid or mitigate retaliation from the Threat, Reduce Threat. An
    ]{.c0} [Edge]{.c2} [ that increases their effectiveness might give
    Increased Effect.]{.c3 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Using an ]{.c0} [Expertise]{.c2} [, they can trade a die for an
    ]{.c0} [Edge]{.c2} [.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [They can choose to ]{.c0} [Push]{.c2} [ themselves for Increased
    Effect.]{.c3 .c0}

# [Consequences]{.c13 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.pz13buq880la .c5}

[Inflicted by enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a
roll. informs the Harm level, the ticks on a Track, the severity of the
Complication, etc]{.c3 .c0}

-   [Reduced Effect:]{.c2} [ their action falls short and causes Reduced
    Effect.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Harm:]{.c2} [ lasting condition or injury. Requires time or
    treatment to recover.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Complication:]{.c2} [ compromise assets (e.g. cyber becomes
    GLITCHED), deplete resources (e.g. ammo), start and/or advance a
    troublesome Progress Track.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Threat Escalation:]{.c2} [ they lose control of the situation, take
    away an Edge or safeguard to Increase Threat.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Lost Opportunity:]{.c2} [ circumstances shift, they must find a new
    approach.]{.c3 .c0}

[Combine these as the fiction dictates. ]{.c0} [E.g. a Runner facing a
Threat 3 enemy rolls a Failure. As a Consequence, the GM could deal a
level 3 Harm or a level 1 Harm and have the enemy disarm them.]{.c1 .c0}

[Runners can ]{.c0} [Resist]{.c2} [ each Consequence separately.]{.c3
.c0}

[Each Harm Level implies a penalty to pertinent Action Rolls (may be
disregarded later by Taking a Breather). When a PC takes Harm of a Level
already filled, it moves on to a greater Level. If they take Harm but
there is no slot left to fill, it's Time to Die.]{.c3 .c0}

[Therefore, Level 4 harm is FATAL if not Resisted and should be
inflicted only when the stakes are clear.]{.c3 .c0}

# [Progress Tracks]{.c13 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.ulkq49mq0bwj .c5}

[Assign Progress Tracks of 4, 6, or 8 segments when a situation is
complex and you need to track ongoing effort or progress over
time---otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll.
Even more complex obstacles might feature layered Tracks to represent
the multiple steps needed to overcome it.]{.c3 .c0}

[When PCs make progress towards an objective, tick a number of segments
in the Progress Track equal to their Effect Level. When progress is made
by an opposition, tick a number of segments equal to the Threat
Level.]{.c3 .c0}

[Employ Progress Tracks to:]{.c3 .c0}

-   [Mark ]{.c2} [progress]{.c2} [ on a task:]{.c2} [ the endurance of
    an enemy; a system's integrity. The task is completed when the
    Progress Track fills up.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Set up a countdown:]{.c2} [ reinforcements' arrival; a time bomb.
    Trouble ensues when the Track fills up.]{.c3 .c0}
-   [Represent a race:]{.c2} [ a hacker infiltrating a network while
    security closes in. Set two opposed Tracks, they don't even have to
    be the same size.]{.c3 .c0}

# [Adversary Skill]{.c13 .c2} {#CBRPNKCoreRulesv1.5PagelessPlainText.xhtml#h.jvprryvhj8a4 .c5}

[Adversaries' capabilities manifest through Progress Tracks, the
severity of the Consequences they deal (as a result of fictional
standings), and ultimately, their Skill level.]{.c3 .c0}

[When ]{.c0} [Regular]{.c2} [ adversaries are involved, the PCs' Action
Rolls determine the outcome for both sides simultaneously. A single roll
tells us how their actions interact and which Consequences result.]{.c3
.c0}

[When ]{.c0} [Skilled]{.c2} [ adversaries act, they are about to
accomplish something. How the Runners respond---and their
rolls---determine how effective the adversary was.]{.c3 .c0}

[By taking the initiative, when ]{.c0} [Elite]{.c2} [ adversaries act
they can inflict a Consequence that must be Resisted before the Runners
also have a chance to act.]{.c3 .c0}
